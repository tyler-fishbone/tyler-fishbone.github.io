      <h2 class="hStory"> The Catastrophe... </h2>
      <p>
        ...happens hundreds of years in the future, when everything is better than everthing is now (and after everything got way, way worse than things are now), our society develops time travel. Further still, we develop it into a common household technology! It's mostly harmless. We even have a branch of law enforcement that deals specifially with time shenanigans!
      </p>
      <p>
        Anyway, as with every great technology there are some who missuse it. Of all the things that are cured in the future, colorblindness was not one. There came one man whose name was lost to time but was one such affected by colorblindess. Instead of the usualy red and green loss, this fellow suffered blue and green loss. A genius by all regards, he specialized in most fields of physics, of which time was his strongest subject. He found a way to create a paradox powerful enough to collapse the spectrum of light of all photons in reality in order for light to not appear in a certain wavelength. He did this twice, successfully removing both green and blue from reality.

      <h2 class="hStory"> The Resolution... </h2>
      <p>
        ...to this horrible event came from the brave scientists in our time. They were finally able to figure out how this man was able to do what he did, and even how to reverse what he had done! However, everything involved with time travel is incredibly delicate. While reversing the effects of one of his trips would be simple, trying to fix both would likely do more harm than good, so the infernal question was asked: which do we sacrifice? Which do we keep?
      </p>
      <p>
        Thankfully, however, someone from the distant past had already posed this question to the world and found an answer! So, the color the world chose was reinstated back into the world, and we learned to live on without the other color.

        ...is yours! Green or Blue? Which color do you like more? Leave your votes and explanations in the comments! Tell us why you chose what you did! Tell other people why they are wrong about what they feel! Tell THOSE people what you really think of them!

        But most of all, have fun!

    <h2> Q and A </h2>
    <p class="question">
      Q. Are you from the future?
    </p>
    <p class="answer">
      A. Yes we are! We were sent from the government of earth from the future to facilitate this voting process so that we can come to a swift resolution after the catastrophe in the future!
    </p>
    <p class="question">
      Q. If you're from the future, don't you know which side wins?
    </p>
    <p class="answer">
      A. Why yes! We know absolutely everything about what happens! We know which color is chosen and what life is like without the other color. To be honest, we were all a little shooken up to see this color for the first time ever!
    </p>
    <p class="question">
      Q. Why did you come back if you already know which side won?
    </p>
    <p class="answer">
      A. Well, my ignorant friend, you must have never gotten involved in time shenanigans! While some would hypothesize that we come back out of necessity of preserving our own timeline, this is simply not true! In fact we do this simply to close the time loop so that you guys aren't lost in the future! Basically, this is all an act of charity for your timeline!
    </p>
    <p class="question">
      Q. Isn't it dangerous for you to come back class="question" in time?
    </p>
    <p class="answer">
      A. Very! However, my friends and I were really excited to come back in time that we didn't even consider the ramifications!
    </p>
    <p class="question">
      Q. ...Did your government actually send you?
    </p>
    <p class="answer">
      A. Nope! That was a lie!
    </p>
    <p class="question">
      Q. ...Was everything else a lie too?
    </p>
    <p class="answer">
      A. Might be! But to be honest, it doesn't really matter. We don't really care if you believe all of this, we just want you to vote!
